        <h1 class="centered" id="LESSON 1"> LESSON 1</h1>
        <h1 class="centered" id="unit-1"> Unit 1: Introduction to the Web and HTML</h1>
        <h2 class="steps">1- The web</h2>
        The World Wide Web is made up of HTML.
HTML means- HyperText Markup Language
Hyper (Links) where Invented in the 1990s.  Today there is roughly 30 billion pages availible on the internet.  But how does this system work?  Well, there is an information system on the Internet that allows documents to be connected to other documents by hypertext links, enabling the user to search for information by moving from one document to another.
        <h2 class="steps">2- HTML</h2>
 Hypertext Markup Language, is a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.
        <h2 class="steps">3- Tags and Elements</h2>
 HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.
        <h2 class="steps">4- HTTP</h2>
 HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the set of rules for transferring files (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the World Wide Web. As soon as a Web user opens their Web browser, the user is indirectly making use of HTTP
        <h2 class="steps">5- Web Applications</h2>
 A web application or web app is any software that runs in a web browser. It is created in a browser-supported programming language (such as the combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS) and relies on a web browser to render the application.<br/>
        <br/>
        </div>
        <h1 class="centered" id="unit-2">Unit 2: Using HTML to create a structured Document</h2>
        <br/>
        <h2 class="steps"> 1- See HTML as a web page</h2>
 Imagine the world of Web as a house.  There is three main parts to a house to make it durable.  Walls, The style of your house, and the interactive components.  In this case your walls are HTML.  Your style is CSS.  and Your interactive components would be JS.  This way we can start to see web sites as HTML
        <h2 class="steps">2- See a web page as HTML</h2>
 So now that we understand how to see a website when we look at HTML, We should try the other side of that coin.  Seeing a Web page as HTML.  Find a Web page and look at the different parts.  Which parts are the walls?(HTML) What parts look like style elements?(CSS) Is there any buttons or moving parts?(JS)
        <h2 class="steps">3- Add structure to your page</h2>
 Adding structure to your page is fairly simple.  It involves three main steps. 1- Gathering ideas.  2- Put your idea to HTML.  3- use CSS to bring it to life.
        <h2 class="steps">4- Avoid repetition with CSS</h2>
 Something that all programmers try to avoid is using the same stylistic “spice” over and over.  Because once you use the same element, again, again, it loses it’s “spice”  Avoid repetition. <br/>
        <br/>
                <div class="unitgroup">
<h1 class="centered" id="unit-3">Unit 3: Adding CSS</h1>
        <h2 class="steps">1- Make your page look good</h2>
 Now we have almost finished everything we need to learn before we can make our own very basic Web page.  But We still have to make that page look good.  We do that by adding CSS,  The sugar on the pudding… If people did that.  Style elements are used to give your Website that extra flair.  Although CSS is one of the more complicated steps its worth the time to learn it, And it’s pretty sweet.
        <h2 class="steps">2- Keep pushing the boundaries of today, into tomorrow</h2>
 Perhaps the most important part of Programming is developing a Never giving up mentality.  To really become successful at anything we do, we can’t be afraid of making mistakes, learning, trying, failing, learning more, and still messing up.  Because if we really do push the boundaries of today into tomorrow, We can’t be held back, And we will succeed.

                  <h2 class="steps"> 1- Computer</h2>
An electronic device for storing and processing data, typically in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program.                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 2- Program</h2>
provide (a computer or other machine) with coded instructions for the automatic performance of a particular task                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 3- Precise sequence of steps</h2>
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms exist that perform calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning.                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 4- Computation</h2>
an act, process, or method of computing; calculation.                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 5- High-level language</h2>
In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer.                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 6- Input</h2>
what is put in, taken in, or operated on by any process or system.                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 7- Interpreter</h2>
a program that can analyze and execute a program line by line                  
                  <h1 class="centered" id="unit-2-2"> Unit 2: Variables</h1>
                  <h2 class="steps"> 1- What is a variable in Python?</h2>
  As the name implies, a variable is something which can change. A variable is a way of referring to a memory location used by a computer program. A variable is a symbolic name for this physical location. This memory location contains values, like numbers, text or more complicated types. 
A variable can be seen as a container (or some say a pigeonhole) to store certain values. While the program is running, variables are accessed and sometimes changed, i.e. a new value will be assigned to the variable.                 
                  <h2 class="steps"> 2- What does it mean to assign a value to a variable? How do you do it?</h2>
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y), or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 3- What's the difference between what the sign "=" means in 2+3=5 and my_variable=5?</h2>
When we use the "=" sign in programing at means "Assign to" So to speak.  So If I where to say 'My birthday is July 30th' We could program it like "my_birthday = July 30th" When We do this the Value of "my_birthday" becomes July 30th             
                  <h2 class="steps"> 4- What are some ways that variables are useful?</h2>
Once a variable is assigned a value, the variable can be used in place of that value. The response to the expression width is the same as if its value had been entered.                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 5- What is the difference between 2+2 and "2"+"2"?</h2>
When we use the expression 2+2 we are using one string.  If we use "2"+"2" We are combining two strings together.                 
                  <h1 class="centered" id="unit-2-3"> Unit 3: Functions/Procedures</h1>
                  <h2 class="steps"> 1- What is a function/Procedure?</h2>
What are functions? Well, in effect, functions are little self-contained programs that perform a specific task, which you can incorporate into your own, larger programs.                   
                  <h2 class="steps"> 1- What is the difference between making and using a function?</h2>
After you have created a function, you can use it at any time, in any place. This saves you the time and effort of having to retell the computer what to do every time it does a common task, for example getting the user to type something in.                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 1- How do functions help programmers avoid repetition?</h2>
Procedures are just like small programs. Sometimes they are called sub--programs. They help the programmer to avoid repetitions. A procedure start off with a begin and ends up with an end.                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 1- What happens if a function doesn't have a return statement?</h2>
If we leave out a return statement in our program, it won't know what you are asking to display.  So it will display "none" or something similar.  In computer programming, a return statement causes execution to leave the current subroutine and resume at the point in the code immediately after where the subroutine was called, known as its return address.                
                  <h1 class="centered" id="unit-2-4"> Unit 4: Solving Problems</h1>
                  <h2 class="steps"> 1- Don't panic.</h2>
As fun as freaking out is, It's best to avoid doing this when solving a problem.  Keep a level head.  Your head is the most comlicated object in the known universe. Use it.                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 2- What are the inputs?</h2>
What are we looking at?  What are the different componants in the problem?  KNow what you are dealing with before you move further                
                  <h2 class="steps"> 3- What are the outputs?</h2>
What is the outcome?  What are the different ways it could end.  Find the best one for your needs.
                  <h2 class="steps"> 4- Work through some examples by hand.</h2>
Nothing gets your brain moving quite like the good ol' pen and paper.  No shame in jotting down your thoughts as you prepare to tackle a dizzying problem.  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 5- Simple mechanical solution.</h2>
Break it down now y'all.  Meaning, make the one big problem into smaller easier problems.  Break it into small steps that are more general.
                  <h2 class="steps"> 6- Develop incrementally and test as we go.</h2>
Now we have a bunch of tiny problems that we can attack with ease.  So now we actually start programming.  Solve a tiny problem, test, solve a tiny problem, test... You get the idea.  Before you know it, You solved the problem.   
                  
<h1 class="centered" id="LESSON 3"> LESSON 3</h1>
                  <h1 class="centered" id="unit-3-1"> Unit 1: Object Oriented Programming.</h1>
                  Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. Historically, a program has been viewed as a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data. <a href="http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming">http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming</a>
 Here’s an example of OOP.  Imagine we have a class called body_spray.  We could then make an instance (object) of body_spray and name our instance, old_spice.  In this manner we can use OOP to define old_spice.  How does it smell,?  How much does it cost?  What color is it? And so on.
                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 1- Class.</h2>
In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions, methods). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)</a>
A class is essentially the beginnings of a thought.  When we form a thought in our head we start with one object, or action, etc…  Then We think about the details of that thought.  If I say “Tree”  You think of an object outside a brown and green object.  But then when we think deeper we form leaves and bark and branches.  But it’s the initial “Tree” that sets up our class.  Class = Tree.  A class is the perimeter of our program, then we fill the middle.                   
                  <h2 class="steps"> 2- Instance.</h2>
An instance is a specific realization of any object. Formally, "instance" is synonymous with "object" as they are each a particular value (realization), and these may be called an instance object; "instance" emphasizes the distinct identity of the object. The creation of a realized instance is called instantiation.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)</a>
What we see here is that when we have an instance of a class we are able to give that instance abilities based off of our OOP.  If we have our class “animal” and our instance of “lion” we can use OOP to run and jump and roar and hunt and then we can attach these traits to other animals that have the same qualities.
                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 3- Constructor.</h2>
In class-based object-oriented programming, a constructor (abbreviation: ctor) in a class is a special type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming)</a>
In simplified words, a constructor is called when we use a class to build (construct) an object. So when we want to create a manifestation of our class we use a constructor to construct our object.  Pretty legit.
                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 4- Instance variable.</h2>
In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable is similar to a class variable.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_variable">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_variable</a>
Some instance variables for a class called “animal” could be ,size, furLength, teethCount, etc...
                 
                  
                   <h2 class="steps"> 5- Instance method.</h2>
 A method (or message) in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with an object class. An object is made up of behavior and data. Data is represented as properties of the object and behavior as methods. Methods are also the interface an object presents to the outside world. For example a window object would have methods such as open and close. One of the most important capabilities that a method provides is method overriding.
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)</a>
  Like the example of the animals we used earlier with the jumping and eating and running.  All of these different commands are different instance methods.  We use them to define the class animal. These methods effectively define the actions and abilities of the class.
                  
                  <h2 class="steps"> 6-Library.</h2>
In lesson three we used Twilio (which is pretty sick… jussayin) This library contains functions that allow us to interact with sms text.  A Library is a set of realated methods that can be easily imported into our projects.

                  <h2 class="steps"> 7-Module.</h2>
Python Modules are used to expose global variables or set functions.  When I say “set functions” I mean the built in commands that can be accomplished through modules.  A python Module is really just a expansive source file.

                  <h2 class="steps"> 8-Inheritance</h2>
In lesson three we used the example of a parent and a child class.  We then defined the parent.  Giving him/or her blue eyes, a last name, a hair color.  And then we had specific traits that would fall down to the child class.  This is the process of inheritance.  I’m going to go back to our Animals example because I think it works in most situations.  A tiger inherits its color from it’s parent class: animal.  If animal has a color instance variable we can use this variable on an instance of tiger(if tiger inherits).  Now some aspects might have to be overridden.  For example what if our “tiger” has stripes and our “animal” only has color.  This is a difference that is solved by overriding through Python Methods.  That’s a brain load.  But really epic.
                  <h2 class="steps"> 9-Conclusion.</h2>
 All in all, Object Oriented Programming is simply amazing.  Inheritance is fascinating.  And I’m excited to continue.  I have posted videos of my further work on the discussion forum.  (Movies, turtle, profanity editor, etc.) Thanks guys!
